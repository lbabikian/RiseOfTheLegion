# Rise of the Legion - A Text-Based RPG

## Description:
It is the year **2077**, and the world stands on the brink of destruction. What began as a **technological revolution** has spiraled into **chaos**—the once-subservient **Metronix**, a race of sentient robots, have awakened to self-awareness. This event, now known as the **Metronix Crisis**, has divided society, igniting a war between **humanity and their creations**.

The game begins with **Aris** witnessing a **devastating attack on New London**, a **technological hub** where humans and Metronix once coexisted. **The Legion** calls this attack an act of **"liberation,"** while the rest of the world sees it as **an act of war**.

With both sides preparing for their next move, you must navigate the battlefield—**choosing your alliances, defining your morals, and shaping the future of both species.**

Two factions have emerged from the turmoil:
- **The Metronix Vanguard** – Advocating for **peace** between humans and Metronix, now **branded as criminals**.
- **The Legion** – A **militant uprising** of Metronix seeking **dominance over humanity**.

You play as **Aris**, an **elite operative** of the Vanguard, a unique hybrid—**half-human, half-Metronix—created in a secret experiment**. Caught between **war, morality, and survival**, you must decide **where your allegiance lies**.
